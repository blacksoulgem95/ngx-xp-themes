## Adding icons:
1. if is a new iconpack, add it to the `extract-icon-names.js` file in order to be processed
2. add the icon png file to the assets/{icon pack type} folder
3. from the main project run
```
npm run generate-icons
```
and test locally that they work.

The icons will be generated in the `projects\ngx-xp-icons\src\lib` folder and the `public-api.ts` will be updated.

the generated assets will be gitignored as they'll be re-generated by CI for publishing.

## Name rules for Icons:
No parenthesis, preferably in the format `icon-name.png` or `icon name.png`
